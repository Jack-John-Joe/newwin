newwin mode

basically an explorer.exe ripoff
explorer.exe won't be used as a shell and instead only as the file manager
a new shell will be implemented to replace it







for THOSE people:
god why can't you understand that a shell (bash) and a shell (explorer) are two different things
even microsoft calls it shell goddddd :sob:
