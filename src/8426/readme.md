# 8426 (couldn't come up with better name so I just hit the keys on my numpad with arrows on them)
ProcessManager from Project Lisa (thing i'm working on, you'll learn more in E4 if I can get it working by then, extremely unstable)
# but what does it do
just makes everything with apps in newwin easier
